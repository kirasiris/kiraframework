You will need to set your document root to the `public` directory. Here are some instructions for setting the document root for some popular local development tools:

**XAMPP**
If you are using XAMPP, you can set the document root in the httpd.conf file. Here is an example:

```
DocumentRoot "C:/xampp/htdocs/kira/public"
<Directory "C:/xampp/htdocs/kira/public">
```

**SET YOUR DB INFORMATION**
Access the `.env` file within the root folder, in there you will find all the variables that you can customize according to your liking.
